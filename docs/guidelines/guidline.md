                - description & typical example:

                    Indicates the techniques used to determine the superconductiving transition temperature, either by experimental measurements or theoretical calculations. This includes also the study of temperature/resistivity, temperature/magnetic field graphs, not necessarily related to superconductivity (what does this mean?).
